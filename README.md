# Python Game with OOP and MVC Architecture

This project was developed as part of the final assignment for the "Fundamentals of Programming" class at UBB Cluj-Napoca. It is a game built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and it respects the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

## Features:
- **Object-Oriented Design**: The game is structured using classes and objects to model game components and interactions.
- **MVC Architecture**: The project is designed following the MVC pattern to separate the game logic, user interface, and input/output handling.
- **Multiple Interfaces**: The game supports both a Graphical User Interface (GUI) built with Tkinter and a Console-based interface.
